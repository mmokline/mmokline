Hi, I’m Iyed — currently in my second year at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr), where I explore the intersection of **Statistics**, **Quantitative Finance**, and **Data Science**.

I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just interesting discussions.

**Overview:**  
This project models and simulates optimal pacing strategies for a 1500m middle-distance runner.  
Combining real physiological measurements and mathematical modeling, I used sinusoidal velocity profiles and optimization algorithms to outperform actual athlete benchmarks.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python · Scipy · Matplotlib · Numerical Optimization · Energetic Modeling · Aftalion-Bonnans Framework
